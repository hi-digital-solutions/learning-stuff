Your task is to write a function that takes two arguments,
a string and an integer width.

The function returns the string, but with line breaks
inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line
is longer than the column number.
You try to break lines at word boundaries.

Like a word processor, break the line by replacing
the last space in a line with a newline.

          // int adjustedColumnWidth = 0;
          // char character;
          // bool isCharacter = true;
          // string line = words.Substring(0,columnWidth);
          // string nextline = words.Substring(columnWidth, columnWidth);
          // string testString = line + "\n" + nextline;

          // while(isCharacter == true)
          // {
              //if the line break lands a character, then decrement column with by one until no character is found

          // }
